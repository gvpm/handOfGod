##The Concept

####The initial idea was based on 2 things:

– An environment where “beings” would born, grow and die independently.
– Interactions that would affect this environment, changing its balance somehow, and affecting and controlling the beings.

The project is called handOfGod because the way the interactions are triggered is by moving the hand on top of “The Bible”

####Why and What is the bible?

The reason why the trigger chosen was “The Bible” came from a movie from 2010 called “The Book of Eli” where Eli, the main character, travels in a post apocalyptic world with one goal, deliver this “powerful” book he has somewhere safe where it would be used in a good way.

Eli stumbles upon a city where its Mayor knows about and it is looking for a book that he believes it can give him power to rule all the other cities because contains the knowledge required to control other people.

The book is The Bible, and that is the critique. Sadly, the bible, the coran and religion in general was  used through the years by some people acting in bad faith with the sole intention of obtaining or increasing their power/influence and controlling people to act in their behalf .
